# Write, in a file called mario.py, a program that recreates the half-pyramid using hashes (#) for blocks, exactly as you did in Problem Set 1, except that your program this time should be written in Python.

# To make things more interesting, first prompt the user with get_int for the half-pyramidâ€™s height, a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive.
# If the user fails to provide a positive integer no greater than 8, you should re-prompt for the same again.

import cs50

while True:
	height = cs50.get_int("Choose the height of your pyramid from 1 to 8\n")
	if 1 <= height <= 8:
		break

# Then, generate (with the help of print and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid.
# Take care to align the bottom-left corner of your half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window.

	spaces = ' ' * (height - i)
