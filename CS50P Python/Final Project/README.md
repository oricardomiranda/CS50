Creating an entire project may seem daunting. Here are some questions that you should think about as you start:

What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The software will take a family income, the monthly expenses and make calculations so that each member contributes in a fair manner.
Features: 
1 - Will save the name and salary of each family member
2 - Will reserve 10% of each member for savings
3 - Will save all fixed monthly expenses
4 - Will calculate how much each member has to contribute, taking the person's salary in consideration

Execution:
1 - Double click to start or python command
2 - Print instructions to guide the person. 1 - Show Earnings and savings 2 - Show expenses 3 - Add expenses 4 - Remove expenses
What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
DB manipulation?
How to show data in table in terminal. SQL queries?
If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?
N/A
In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?
1 - Essential: Saving expenses and salaries and divide equally
2 - Very desired: Update salaries and expenses and divide by %
3 - GTH: Interaction menu and some way to show the data in table. sql query?
Consider making goal milestones to keep you on track.



Create a README.md text file (named exactly that!) in your ~/project folder that explains your project. This file should include your Project title, the URL of your video (created in step 1 above) and a description of your project. You may use the below as a template.
