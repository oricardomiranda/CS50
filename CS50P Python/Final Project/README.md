Creating an entire project may seem daunting. Here are some questions that you should think about as you start:

What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?
In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?
Consider making goal milestones to keep you on track.



Create a README.md text file (named exactly that!) in your ~/project folder that explains your project. This file should include your Project title, the URL of your video (created in step 1 above) and a description of your project. You may use the below as a template.
