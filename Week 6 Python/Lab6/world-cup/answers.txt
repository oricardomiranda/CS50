Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:


Some predictions were really random
Some predictions were really random

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 10000 runs we can get good results
